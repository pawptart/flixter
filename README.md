# Flixter

Flixter is was built in Ruby on Rails 5.2.1 as part of a project for Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp.

Flixter is a video sharing app designed to let instructors upload courses, lessons, and videos for learners to understand complicated topics. It is modeled after sites like Udemy or Coursera and hosts all its content on Amazon S3. Flixter uses Stripe to accept user payment (currently in a test account).
